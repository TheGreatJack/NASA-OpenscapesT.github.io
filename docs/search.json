The main focus is to try to find population structure in those datasets. I also wanted to study some concepts of population genetics here. This is not necessarily an state of the art reanalysis of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raw reads consist of 192 Illumina PE libraries. Each library corresponds to an individual from four korean companies [3]. The reads were retrieved with SRA-Explorer [1], using the SRA(Sequence read archive) accesion code: SRP150117.\n\n\n\nThe reference genome was downloaded from the NCBI with assembly accesion code: GCA_905187595.1. The associated paper is [2].\n\n\n\n\n\nStacks V2.64\nfastp V0.23.4\nSamtools"
